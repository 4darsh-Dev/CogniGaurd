160,Jerry B.I have not finished it yet but it was very easy to install and look and works nice so farHeather C.The fan is so loud and annoying!!!
161,I had my old firebox and it was perfect ( until it caught fire) this was the replacement and I can't wait for it to shut off everytime it's on.
162,It's a big pitch winding noise that is absolutely horrible to listen to and cancels all the other good qualities of this box.

200,I live in southeast Texas where it is hot 10 months of the year so I wanted an electric fireplace that I could enjoy year round.
201,I didn’t want a fake look and this fireplace has the most realistic flame of all the ones we researched.
202,It has even fooled some of our friends.
203,The customer service at electric fireplace depot has been excellent.
204,I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!Alan S.Shipped quickly easy install looks so real everyone that sees it is amazed.thank you for a wonderful product Jennifer K.Received the unit but the wrong plug kit was sent.
205,Don’t really have any comments because the project is on hold pending receipt of the correct plug kit.
206,It has been almost four weeks since this mess and started and I still have no assurance when the plug kit will be sent.
207,My one comment is that that the unit should not have been shipped with a plug kit that was not correct just to “complete” the order.
208,"I don’t care if it was the fault of the manufacturer or the distributor, the entire process has been frustrating and inexcusable since you have my money and I just sit here waiting."
209,The bottom line is that I would not recommend your company to anyone.
210,I do plan to post a complete review on social media as well.Laura T.Customer Svs.
211,was great on the phone.
212,Came in matter of days.
213,And it looks fantastic!!!
214,"There's a reason why Dimplex is number one!Francis B.I like the fireplace insert, however there is a bumping noise that I hear when the fan isn’t running."
215,I think it may be the flicker rod but haven’t yet been able to access it for evaluation.
216,Also not crazy about the magnetic attachment of the door frame.
217,Maybe more magnets would help.MelissaWe like the fireplace.
218,The flames are very real.
219,We especially like open face design of this fireplace.
220,We wish for more heat at 110V.

406,Jerry B.I have not finished it yet but it was very easy to install and look and works nice so farHeather C.The fan is so loud and annoying!!!
407,I had my old firebox and it was perfect ( until it caught fire) this was the replacement and I can't wait for it to shut off everytime it's on.
408,It's a big pitch winding noise that is absolutely horrible to listen to and cancels all the other good qualities of this box.
409,I thought people were exaggerating but they're not.
410,It's horrible.
411,":( I wish I could get the same as my old one.Christine C.Beautiful, very happy."
412,"Great company, Great salesperson."
413,"Delivery as promised.DIANE M.The electrician is still making the frame to go around it, so it will look like it should be there."
414,"The only thing I have noticed that I don’t like, is after about a week it started making a grinding noise."
415,"You don’t notice it when the fans on, but I don’t always use the fan."

427,"Two friends who saw it were very impressed and are considering this fireplace for their homes.Veronica H.We like the loom if it, but were not informed before ordering that an electrician is needed to connect it."
428,The ads implied ut was easy to just plug in.
429,Not the case.Steve S.Love it!
430,"So easy to use, beautiful and create such a warm and inviting atmosphere."

432,Can't say enough good things!Brian P.We have the fireplace insert and the doors but have not installed any of it because the electrical plug in kit has been back-ordered for some time now.
433,We hope we will like it and can give a better review once we can get it all installed.
434,PAULA E.I’m searching for a carpenter to build my mantel.
435,Thomas M.I built the surround myself.
436,The Fireplace insert came all ready to go.
437,"Once I completed the surround, the insert slid right into place with no issue."
438,Looks beautiful and the heater actually warms our den up by 11 degrees (Fahrenheit).Nate R.Absolutely love it!
439,"For a retro-fit of a wood burning fireplace, it worked perfectly."
440,Highly recommend this unitSteven C.Love it!
441,It looks like a real fire.
442,Everyone thinks it’s a gas fireplace.
443,My only complaint is that it doesn’t sound and smell like a real wood burning fire.
444,"Mike H.Researched, Ordered, Received, Installed."
445,Love it!GraceI’m so impressed with the Dimplex Revillusion fireplace insert.
446,I live in southeast Texas where it is hot 10 months of the year so I wanted an electric fireplace that I could enjoy year round.
447,I didn’t want a fake look and this fireplace has the most realistic flame of all the ones we researched.
448,It has even fooled some of our friends.
449,The customer service at electric fireplace depot has been excellent.
450,I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!Alan S.Shipped quickly easy install looks so real everyone that sees it is amazed.thank you for a wonderful product Jennifer K.Received the unit but the wrong plug kit was sent.
451,Don’t really have any comments because the project is on hold pending receipt of the correct plug kit.
452,It has been almost four weeks since this mess and started and I still have no assurance when the plug kit will be sent.
453,My one comment is that that the unit should not have been shipped with a plug kit that was not correct just to “complete” the order.
454,"I don’t care if it was the fault of the manufacturer or the distributor, the entire process has been frustrating and inexcusable since you have my money and I just sit here waiting."
455,The bottom line is that I would not recommend your company to anyone.
456,I do plan to post a complete review on social media as well.Laura T.Customer Svs.
457,was great on the phone.
458,Came in matter of days.
459,And it looks fantastic!!!
460,"There's a reason why Dimplex is number one!Francis B.I like the fireplace insert, however there is a bumping noise that I hear when the fan isn’t running."
461,I think it may be the flicker rod but haven’t yet been able to access it for evaluation.
462,Also not crazy about the magnetic attachment of the door frame.
463,Maybe more magnets would help.MelissaWe like the fireplace.
464,The flames are very real.
465,We especially like open face design of this fireplace.
466,We wish for more heat at 110V.

665,Jerry B.I have not finished it yet but it was very easy to install and look and works nice so farHeather C.The fan is so loud and annoying!!!
666,I had my old firebox and it was perfect ( until it caught fire) this was the replacement and I can't wait for it to shut off everytime it's on.

692,We hope we will like it and can give a better review once we can get it all installed.
693,PAULA E.I’m searching for a carpenter to build my mantel.

704,Love it!GraceI’m so impressed with the Dimplex Revillusion fireplace insert.
705,I live in southeast Texas where it is hot 10 months of the year so I wanted an electric fireplace that I could enjoy year round.
706,I didn’t want a fake look and this fireplace has the most realistic flame of all the ones we researched.

709,I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!Alan S.Shipped quickly easy install looks so real everyone that sees it is amazed.thank you for a wonderful product Jennifer K.Received the unit but the wrong plug kit was sent.
710,Don’t really have any comments because the project is on hold pending receipt of the correct plug kit.
711,It has been almost four weeks since this mess and started and I still have no assurance when the plug kit will be sent.
712,My one comment is that that the unit should not have been shipped with a plug kit that was not correct just to “complete” the order.
713,"I don’t care if it was the fault of the manufacturer or the distributor, the entire process has been frustrating and inexcusable since you have my money and I just sit here waiting."
714,The bottom line is that I would not recommend your company to anyone.

720,I think it may be the flicker rod but haven’t yet been able to access it for evaluation.
721,Also not crazy about the magnetic attachment of the door frame.
722,Maybe more magnets would help.MelissaWe like the fireplace.
723,The flames are very real.

1325,Jerry B.I have not finished it yet but it was very easy to install and look and works nice so farHeather C.The fan is so loud and annoying!!!
1326,I had my old firebox and it was perfect ( until it caught fire) this was the replacement and I can't wait for it to shut off everytime it's on.
1327,It's a big pitch winding noise that is absolutely horrible to listen to and cancels all the other good qualities of this box.
1328,I thought people were exaggerating but they're not.
1329,It's horrible.
1330,":( I wish I could get the same as my old one.Christine C.Beautiful, very happy."
1331,"Great company, Great salesperson."
1332,"Delivery as promised.DIANE M.The electrician is still making the frame to go around it, so it will look like it should be there."
1333,"The only thing I have noticed that I don’t like, is after about a week it started making a grinding noise."
1334,"You don’t notice it when the fans on, but I don’t always use the fan."
1335,So this is very annoying.RobertRealistic look.
1336,Fast delivery!

1343,Unit came on immediately and looks very realistic.
1344,Have not been able to sit and enjoy due to remodeling of family room.
1345,I am confident the fireplace will make our evenings very cozy and pleasant.
1346,"Two friends who saw it were very impressed and are considering this fireplace for their homes.Veronica H.We like the loom if it, but were not informed before ordering that an electrician is needed to connect it."
1347,The ads implied ut was easy to just plug in.
1348,Not the case.Steve S.Love it!
1349,"So easy to use, beautiful and create such a warm and inviting atmosphere."
1350,This is the THIRD one we have bought as we keep finding another room to put one in!
1351,Can't say enough good things!Brian P.We have the fireplace insert and the doors but have not installed any of it because the electrical plug in kit has been back-ordered for some time now.
1352,We hope we will like it and can give a better review once we can get it all installed.
1353,PAULA E.I’m searching for a carpenter to build my mantel.
1354,Thomas M.I built the surround myself.
1355,The Fireplace insert came all ready to go.
1356,"Once I completed the surround, the insert slid right into place with no issue."
1357,Looks beautiful and the heater actually warms our den up by 11 degrees (Fahrenheit).Nate R.Absolutely love it!
1358,"For a retro-fit of a wood burning fireplace, it worked perfectly."
1359,Highly recommend this unitSteven C.Love it!
1360,It looks like a real fire.
1361,Everyone thinks it’s a gas fireplace.
1362,My only complaint is that it doesn’t sound and smell like a real wood burning fire.
1363,"Mike H.Researched, Ordered, Received, Installed."
1364,Love it!GraceI’m so impressed with the Dimplex Revillusion fireplace insert.
1365,I live in southeast Texas where it is hot 10 months of the year so I wanted an electric fireplace that I could enjoy year round.
1366,I didn’t want a fake look and this fireplace has the most realistic flame of all the ones we researched.
1367,It has even fooled some of our friends.
1368,The customer service at electric fireplace depot has been excellent.
1369,I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!Alan S.Shipped quickly easy install looks so real everyone that sees it is amazed.thank you for a wonderful product Jennifer K.Received the unit but the wrong plug kit was sent.
1370,Don’t really have any comments because the project is on hold pending receipt of the correct plug kit.
1371,It has been almost four weeks since this mess and started and I still have no assurance when the plug kit will be sent.
1372,My one comment is that that the unit should not have been shipped with a plug kit that was not correct just to “complete” the order.
1373,"I don’t care if it was the fault of the manufacturer or the distributor, the entire process has been frustrating and inexcusable since you have my money and I just sit here waiting."
1374,The bottom line is that I would not recommend your company to anyone.
1375,I do plan to post a complete review on social media as well.Laura T.Customer Svs.
1376,was great on the phone.
1377,Came in matter of days.
1378,And it looks fantastic!!!
1379,"There's a reason why Dimplex is number one!Francis B.I like the fireplace insert, however there is a bumping noise that I hear when the fan isn’t running."
1380,I think it may be the flicker rod but haven’t yet been able to access it for evaluation.
1381,Also not crazy about the magnetic attachment of the door frame.
1382,Maybe more magnets would help.MelissaWe like the fireplace.
1383,The flames are very real.
1384,We especially like open face design of this fireplace.
1385,We wish for more heat at 110V.

1981,Jerry B.I have not finished it yet but it was very easy to install and look and works nice so farHeather C.The fan is so loud and annoying!!!
1982,I had my old firebox and it was perfect ( until it caught fire) this was the replacement and I can't wait for it to shut off everytime it's on.
1983,It's a big pitch winding noise that is absolutely horrible to listen to and cancels all the other good qualities of this box.
1984,I thought people were exaggerating but they're not.
1985,It's horrible.

1989,"The only thing I have noticed that I don’t like, is after about a week it started making a grinding noise."
1990,"You don’t notice it when the fans on, but I don’t always use the fan."

2001,I am confident the fireplace will make our evenings very cozy and pleasant.
2002,"Two friends who saw it were very impressed and are considering this fireplace for their homes.Veronica H.We like the loom if it, but were not informed before ordering that an electrician is needed to connect it."
2003,The ads implied ut was easy to just plug in.
2004,Not the case.Steve S.Love it!
2005,"So easy to use, beautiful and create such a warm and inviting atmosphere."
2006,This is the THIRD one we have bought as we keep finding another room to put one in!
2007,Can't say enough good things!Brian P.We have the fireplace insert and the doors but have not installed any of it because the electrical plug in kit has been back-ordered for some time now.
2008,We hope we will like it and can give a better review once we can get it all installed.
2009,PAULA E.I’m searching for a carpenter to build my mantel.
2010,Thomas M.I built the surround myself.
2011,The Fireplace insert came all ready to go.

2020,Love it!GraceI’m so impressed with the Dimplex Revillusion fireplace insert.
2021,I live in southeast Texas where it is hot 10 months of the year so I wanted an electric fireplace that I could enjoy year round.

2025,I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!Alan S.Shipped quickly easy install looks so real everyone that sees it is amazed.thank you for a wonderful product Jennifer K.Received the unit but the wrong plug kit was sent.
2026,Don’t really have any comments because the project is on hold pending receipt of the correct plug kit.
2027,It has been almost four weeks since this mess and started and I still have no assurance when the plug kit will be sent.
2028,My one comment is that that the unit should not have been shipped with a plug kit that was not correct just to “complete” the order.
2029,"I don’t care if it was the fault of the manufacturer or the distributor, the entire process has been frustrating and inexcusable since you have my money and I just sit here waiting."
2030,The bottom line is that I would not recommend your company to anyone.

2035,"There's a reason why Dimplex is number one!Francis B.I like the fireplace insert, however there is a bumping noise that I hear when the fan isn’t running."
2036,I think it may be the flicker rod but haven’t yet been able to access it for evaluation.
2037,Also not crazy about the magnetic attachment of the door frame.
2038,Maybe more magnets would help.MelissaWe like the fireplace.
2039,The flames are very real.

2398,Jerry B.I have not finished it yet but it was very easy to install and look and works nice so farHeather C.The fan is so loud and annoying!!!
2399,I had my old firebox and it was perfect ( until it caught fire) this was the replacement and I can't wait for it to shut off everytime it's on.
2400,It's a big pitch winding noise that is absolutely horrible to listen to and cancels all the other good qualities of this box.
2401,I thought people were exaggerating but they're not.
2402,It's horrible.
2403,":( I wish I could get the same as my old one.Christine C.Beautiful, very happy."
2404,"Great company, Great salesperson."
2405,"Delivery as promised.DIANE M.The electrician is still making the frame to go around it, so it will look like it should be there."
2406,"The only thing I have noticed that I don’t like, is after about a week it started making a grinding noise."
2407,"You don’t notice it when the fans on, but I don’t always use the fan."
2408,So this is very annoying.RobertRealistic look.
2409,Fast delivery!

2417,Have not been able to sit and enjoy due to remodeling of family room.
2418,I am confident the fireplace will make our evenings very cozy and pleasant.
2419,"Two friends who saw it were very impressed and are considering this fireplace for their homes.Veronica H.We like the loom if it, but were not informed before ordering that an electrician is needed to connect it."
2420,The ads implied ut was easy to just plug in.
2421,Not the case.Steve S.Love it!
2422,"So easy to use, beautiful and create such a warm and inviting atmosphere."
2423,This is the THIRD one we have bought as we keep finding another room to put one in!
2424,Can't say enough good things!Brian P.We have the fireplace insert and the doors but have not installed any of it because the electrical plug in kit has been back-ordered for some time now.
2425,We hope we will like it and can give a better review once we can get it all installed.

2431,"For a retro-fit of a wood burning fireplace, it worked perfectly."
2432,Highly recommend this unitSteven C.Love it!

2438,I live in southeast Texas where it is hot 10 months of the year so I wanted an electric fireplace that I could enjoy year round.

2442,I am extremely satisfied with my purchase!Alan S.Shipped quickly easy install looks so real everyone that sees it is amazed.thank you for a wonderful product Jennifer K.Received the unit but the wrong plug kit was sent.
2443,Don’t really have any comments because the project is on hold pending receipt of the correct plug kit.
2444,It has been almost four weeks since this mess and started and I still have no assurance when the plug kit will be sent.
2445,My one comment is that that the unit should not have been shipped with a plug kit that was not correct just to “complete” the order.
2446,"I don’t care if it was the fault of the manufacturer or the distributor, the entire process has been frustrating and inexcusable since you have my money and I just sit here waiting."
2447,The bottom line is that I would not recommend your company to anyone.

2453,I think it may be the flicker rod but haven’t yet been able to access it for evaluation.
2454,Also not crazy about the magnetic attachment of the door frame.
2455,Maybe more magnets would help.MelissaWe like the fireplace.
2456,The flames are very real.

2618,GraceI’m so impressed with the Dimplex Revillusion fireplace insert.
2619,I live in southeast Texas where it is hot 10 months of the year so I wanted an electric fireplace that I could enjoy year round.

2630,Alan S.Shipped quickly easy install looks so real everyone that sees it is amazed.thank you for a wonderful product Alan S. Shipped quickly easy install looks so real everyone that sees it is amazed.thank you for a wonderful product Jennifer K.Received the unit but the wrong plug kit was sent.
2631,Don’t really have any comments because the project is on hold pending receipt of the correct plug kit.
2632,It has been almost four weeks since this mess and started and I still have no assurance when the plug kit will be sent.
2633,My one comment is that that the unit should not have been shipped with a plug kit that was not correct just to “complete” the order.
2634,"I don’t care if it was the fault of the manufacturer or the distributor, the entire process has been frustrating and inexcusable since you have my money and I just sit here waiting."
2635,The bottom line is that I would not recommend your company to anyone.
2636,I do plan to post a complete review on social media as well.

2654,"Francis B.I like the fireplace insert, however there is a bumping noise that I hear when the fan isn’t running."
2655,I think it may be the flicker rod but haven’t yet been able to access it for evaluation.
2656,Also not crazy about the magnetic attachment of the door frame.
2657,Maybe more magnets would help.
